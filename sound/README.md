# Where are the actual sounds?

There is a Google Drive folder that holds the sounds, because the compressed version is about 145MB.

This folder is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bvNyOcxjq2taruH4BgBfTN2E9kwuVKE0?usp=sharing

There should be a file 'flg_sound.zip'. Please decompress it in this directory.
