Listens on the main port, keeps track of state of things, directs individual speakers

Charlie says that if I write this in Node, he can maintain it

so, node!

Version from regular raspberrian seems out of date with NPM which is a pity.

```
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install npm@latest -g
```

In the directory, the npm is not most recent? `sudo npm install npm@latest -g`

```
sudo npm install
```

Get the ARM v8 version from nodejs.org
sudo tar xvf node-... -C /opt
sudo mv /opt/node.... /opt/node
Add node to everyone's path: /opt/node/bin to /etc/profile
